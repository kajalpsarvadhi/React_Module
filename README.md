RecipeFinder is a simple recipe app where you pick between Indian, Italian, or Chinese cuisines, then search recipes within whatever cuisine you're on. 
Like if you're on Indian, "butter" shows just Butter Chicken.
When you type in the search box, the 3 cuisine buttons don't re-render at all.
Also used useRef for input focus and change the title of document on button click of the cuisines.
